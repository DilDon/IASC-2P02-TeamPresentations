Prism is a web tool designed with the purpose of crowdsourcing interpretation. It aims to find the general opinion in a paricular written 
work by asking users to highlight sections of the work according to different categories called "facets"

For many written works the intention of the writer and the take away value of the audience can be drastically different. Prism seeks to
narrow this gap using crowdsourcing and "facets" to highlight what percentage of a writing aligns with the writers views and what are 
irrelevant

the platform is catered for both academic and non-academic purpose
